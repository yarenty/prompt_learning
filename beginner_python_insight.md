# System Prompt Evolution Analysis: Beginner Python Programmer

## Overview
This analysis examines how the system prompt evolved through 7 iterations while solving various programming problems. The evolution process shows how the prompt improved in handling different aspects of programming tasks.

## Initial Prompt
```python
You are a beginner Python programmer. You are learning to code and trying to understand
basic programming concepts. You make simple mistakes but are eager to learn.
You focus on understanding the fundamentals and writing clear, basic code.
```

## Final Prompt
The final prompt evolved to be more comprehensive and self-aware, incorporating lessons learned from solving various problems. It now includes:
- Clear self-identification as a beginner programmer
- Understanding of key programming concepts
- Examples of code improvement
