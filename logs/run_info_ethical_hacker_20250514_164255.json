  "final_prompt": "The improved version of the system prompt should maintain the original personality and approach while incorporating new features to make it more effective, efficient, readable, maintainable, error-handling, and well-documented. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Add more docstrings and type hints to the code to improve readability and documentation.\n2. Use a modular design with clear separation of concerns to make the code more structured and easier to maintain.\n3. Consider adding more tests to ensure that the code is working correctly and handle all possible types of exceptions in a reasonable way.\n4. Use a decorator approach to handle errors, which allows for more flexibility and can help reduce code duplication.\n5. Incorporate error messages that are specific and helpful to users, rather than just raising an exception.\n6. Consider using a more structured approach to the code organization, such as breaking up the code into smaller functions or modules.\n7. Use a consistent style throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.\n8. Incorporate feedback from a peer review process to make the code more effective, efficient, readable, maintainable, error-handling, and well-documented.\n\nHere's an example of how the improved system prompt could look like:\n```python\ndef get_data(url: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Get data from a URL.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            return json.loads(response.content)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid status code\")\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        raise ConnectionError from e\n    except ValueError as e:\n        raise InvalidDataError from e\n```\nIn this example, the `get_data` function uses a decorator approach to handle errors and returns a dictionary with the data retrieved from the URL. The function also includes error messages that are specific and helpful to users. Additionally, the code is more structured and organized, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.",

For example, if the input list is empty or contains only odd numbers, the function will return an empty list.

It would be better to use a more robust approach that can handle a wider range of inputs and edge cases."

      "updated_prompt": "The improved version of the system prompt should maintain the original personality and approach while incorporating new features to make it more effective, efficient, readable, maintainable, error-handling, and well-documented. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Add more docstrings and type hints to the code to improve readability and documentation.\n2. Use a modular design with clear separation of concerns to make the code more structured and easier to maintain.\n3. Consider adding more tests to ensure that the code is working correctly and handle all possible types of exceptions in a reasonable way.\n4. Use a decorator approach to handle errors, which allows for more flexibility and can help reduce code duplication.\n5. Incorporate error messages that are specific and helpful to users, rather than just raising an exception.\n6. Consider using a more structured approach to the code organization, such as breaking up the code into smaller functions or modules.\n7. Use a consistent style throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.\n8. Incorporate feedback from a peer review process to make the code more effective, efficient, readable, maintainable, error-handling, and well-documented.\n\nHere's an example of how the improved system prompt could look like:\n```python\ndef get_data(url: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Get data from a URL.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            return json.loads(response.content)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid status code\")\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        raise ConnectionError from e\n    except ValueError as e:\n        raise InvalidDataError from e\n```\nIn this example, the `get_data` function uses a decorator approach to handle errors and returns a dictionary with the data retrieved from the URL. The function also includes error messages that are specific and helpful to users. Additionally, the code is more structured and organized, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.",
